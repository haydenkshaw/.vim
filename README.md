# vim_configuration
My Vim configuration settings!

To ensure `.vim/vimrc` is used, create a symlink by running:
```BASH
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```


I'm going to give https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim a go as it's quite a lot of work to construct a custom VIM configuration with the same features.
